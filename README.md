# PyBer_Analysis
Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp - Module 5

## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis summarizes ride sharing data by city type 
from January 2019 through April 2019.  Analysis point is the 
total amount of fares collected per time period for
each city type.  City data was first
summarized into Urban, Suburban, and Rural categories
Fare data for each city type was then summarized by week and 
visulaized by month.  Visualization is a line graph showing
very cleary that PyBer collects far more fares in Urban cities than any
other city type. 

## Results
The first analysis performed is a summary of the total rides, total drivers,
total fares, Avg per Ride, and Avg per Driver.

The data informs us that while we gathered far more fares in Urban cities, these cities also had 
the lowest averge faire per driver and per ride.  This is likely due to shorter rides in Urban cities
since the destinations tend to be closer together.  PyBer also maintains almost three times as many Urban drivers
as Suburban, and almost 15x more drivers than Rural.  

The second analysis performed is a line chart showing fares per city type over time.

## Summary
Based on this analysis, here are three recommendations to address driver/fare
disparities between city types:
1.  Although Rural cities have far fewer rides, the average fare is very high
since the destinations in rural areas tend to be spaced further apart.  Adding more
drivers to the Rural cities could allow us to take advantage of the high fare per ride
2. Fare amounts across each city types begin to spike in March and continues through the Spring.  Adding more drivers
across each city type in March could allow us to capture even more fare revenue in that already busy time.
3. The Urban fare averaage is very low due to extremely high driver counts and the close proximity between distances.  Consider
cutting the number of drivers to increase the fare average.
